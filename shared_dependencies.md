As the task involves only one file, "./pet.py", there are no shared dependencies between multiple files. However, within the file, there might be dependencies such as:

1. Pet Class: The existing 'Pet' class in the file is the primary dependency as we are adding a new field to it.

2. Colour Field: This is the new field we are adding to the 'Pet' class.

3. Class Methods: Any methods within the 'Pet' class that interact with the new 'colour' field. This could include methods for setting or getting the colour, or any methods that use the colour field in their operations.

4. Data Schema: The data schema of the 'Pet' class will be updated to include the new 'colour' field.

Please note that the exact names of these dependencies may vary based on the existing code in the "./pet.py" file.
